**Date:** 2025-06-04  
**Topic:** Introduction to MySQL and SQL Basics

## ðŸ§  Topics Covered

Today, I was introduced to **MySQL**, one of the most popular relational database management systems (RDBMS). Below are the main concepts covered during the session:

### âœ… What is MySQL?

MySQL is an open-source RDBMS that uses SQL (Structured Query Language) to manage and manipulate databases. It is widely used in web development and data management.

## ðŸ“˜ Basic SQL Commands

### 1. Creating a Database

```sql
CREATE DATABASE School;
```

### 2. Creating a Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE Students (
    StudentID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    FirstName VARCHAR(50),
    LastName VARCHAR(50),
    Age INT,
    Grade CHAR(1)
);
```

### 3. Inserting Data

```sql
INSERT INTO Students (StudentID, FirstName, LastName, Age, Grade)
VALUES (1, 'John', 'Doe', 15, 'A');
```

### 4. Retrieving Data

```sql
SELECT * FROM Students;
```

### 5. Filtering Records

```sql
SELECT * FROM Students WHERE Age > 14;
```

### 6. Updating Records

```sql
UPDATE Students SET Grade = 'B' WHERE StudentID = 1;
```

### 7. Deleting Records

```sql
DELETE FROM Students WHERE StudentID = 1;
```
